# WindowsVB-test
Hi All
I am creating all kind of automated projects mainly for model railroad. 
using Arduino and other electronics 
I need administration for parts and finance.
So this project is to create a administration for  www. wisselmotor.nl.  
Not so spectacular as the projects itself but very much needed. 
So learning visual studio 2017 with backend database. 
Thanks for reading
And check out www.wisselmotor.nl
